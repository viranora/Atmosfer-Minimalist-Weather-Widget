5-Hour Forecast: The right panel lists the forecast for the next 5 hours (in 3-hour intervals) in a scrollable area.

Live Background: Features a constantly moving animated gradient background in lilac and pink tones.

Glassmorphism UI: Elements sit modernly on the background using a semi-transparent and blurred 'glass' effect.

API Integration: Fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Electron: To build the cross-platform desktop application.

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+): For all application logic (no framework used).

CSS3: For all styling, animated gradients, flexbox layout, and the 'glassmorphism' effect.

Axios: To make requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.




This project is a personal study created to learn Electron and API integrations.
